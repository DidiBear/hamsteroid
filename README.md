# Hamsteroid

You control a ball using fire and explosions to escape hamsters from a wheeling prison.

## Story

- Hamsters 🐹 are stuck in a prison in which they have to roll wheels to make electricity.
- they want to escape and one of them, which is an engineer, created the ultimate wheeling machine
- you are the hamster controlling the machine that takes some passengers to the exit
- you have to come back to pick up other hamsters, with an increased difficulty.

## Controls

- Fire propulsors 🔥 to have precise movements. Basically using the joistick in the expected direction
- Explosions 💥 to live super fast in one direction

As the machine is a ball, then it rebound everywhere, making the game play erratic with many unexpected things. Kind of like Wand Wars.
